# Parameterized Machine Learning Model Training with PyTorch

This Google Colab notebook provides a flexible, parameterized workflow for loading datasets and models from `torchvision`, training machine learning models, and evaluating them with robust error handling. It also supports optional early stopping to improve training efficiency.

## Overview

The notebook implements a parameterized machine learning pipeline using PyTorch, with options to:
- Select from all available datasets in `torchvision.datasets`
- Choose from a wide range of pre-trained models in `torchvision.models`
- Customize training settings such as epochs, learning rate, and batch size
- Enable optional early stopping based on validation loss with `patience` and `min_delta` parameters

The goal of this project is to provide a flexible, user-friendly, and error-resilient workflow for machine learning training in PyTorch, ideal for experimenting with different datasets and models.

## Features

- **Dataset Selection**: 
    - Users can select from any dataset available in `torchvision.datasets`.
    - If the dataset name is incorrect, the notebook provides suggestions and handles errors gracefully.

- **Model Selection**: 
    - Users can choose from popular models in `torchvision.models` (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet).
    - If an invalid model name is provided, the notebook suggests similar models and handles errors.

- **Training**:
    - Customizable training parameters: epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
    - Uses `tqdm` progress bars to display training progress.
    - Option to enable verbose output for detailed logs of the training process.
  
- **Early Stopping**: 
    - Optionally enable early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
    - Parameters include `patience` (number of epochs to wait for improvement) and `min_delta` (minimum improvement threshold).

- **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluates the model on a test set and prints the final accuracy and loss.

## Setup and Dependencies

The notebook is designed to run in **Google Colab** but can be adapted to other environments with minor modifications.

### Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `tqdm`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

To install dependencies in your environment, you can run:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision tqdm matplotlib numpy
```
### How to Use
### 1. Dataset Selection
In the notebook, you can specify the dataset using the dataset_name parameter. This allows you to choose from any available dataset in torchvision.datasets.

### 2. Model Selection
Similarly, specify the model with the model_name parameter. The notebook supports all major models available in torchvision.models.

### 3. Training
You can configure the following parameters for training:
`epochs`: Number of epochs to train the model.
`learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer.
`batch_size`: Batch size for loading data.
`patience`: Number of epochs with no improvement to wait before early stopping.
`min_delta`: Minimum change in validation loss to qualify as an improvement.
`verbose`: Whether to print detailed logs for each epoch (set to yes or no).
/### 4. Early Stopping
To enable early stopping, you can set the patience and min_delta parameters. The training will stop if the validation loss does not improve for patience epochs.

### 5. Evaluation
After training, the notebook evaluates the model on the test set and prints the final accuracy and loss.
### Example input when running the notebook
```bash
Enter a dataset name from torchvision: CIFAR10
Enter batch size: 32
Enter a model name from torchvision: resnet18
Enter the number of epochs: 20
Enter the learning rate: 0.001
Enter patience for early stopping: 5
Enter minimum delta for improvement: 0.01
Enable verbose output? (yes/no): yes
```
### Output
The notebook will display the following:

Training progress with loss values.
Validation loss after each epoch.
Final accuracy and test loss after evaluation.
Display of Images
The notebook can also display the first few images from the dataset to provide a visual check of the data.
